> **DataMa JOURNEY is a data analysis tool that allows you to quickly visualize journeys and simulate attribution models on your customer touch points.**

<br>

DataMa JOURNEY allows you to understand your customer experience, using the data you're already collecting.
Ultimately, it will allow you to improve your customer experience through data driven insights.
More precisely, you will be able to:

* Visualize your customer journey and communicate it in an appealing format (Sunburst)
* Compare your customer journeys between two segments, or two periods
* Understand where the value comes from, and where it's lost, through an attribution model
* Compare touch points between one another and see what's under/over performing
