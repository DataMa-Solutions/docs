**Similarity Sunburst:**

This sunburst represents the differences in appearance of the various journeys between Desktop and Mobile segments.

On the left part of the sunburst (starting by "positive") are the journeys that have increased in % between start and end. You have more of this type of journeys in your Mobile segment than what you had in your Desktop segment

On the right part of the sunburst (starting with the negative) are the journeys that have decreased in %

Obviously, as this is a 0 sum game, you have as many decreasing journeys as increasing ones,due to the left part and right part (positive and negative) having exactly the same share (50/50)
