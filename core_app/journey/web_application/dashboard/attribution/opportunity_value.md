The Opportunity tab is a graph allowing you to visualize the value attributed to each touch point of the customer journey based on selected attribution model.

![attribution]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/journey/web_application/dashboard/attribution/images/Attribution_Concept.png)

When Compare mode is ON, the gap of value between start and end is a good valuation of the opportunity behind improving the customer experience for a given touch point. It takes into account both the efficiency of the touch point (i.e. the value it brings each time it is seen) and the volume it represents (i.e. the number of users that actually are exposed to this touch point)

![attribution_comparison]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/journey/web_application/dashboard/attribution/images/Value_Comparison.png)


**Example:**

![opportunity]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/journey/web_application/dashboard/attribution/images/opportunity.png)

The biggest opportunity  is "Search" then "Offer" , "Goal_Step2"...

You will be able to quickly identify the steps presenting the biggest opportunity thanks to our decreasing ranking.

Two parameters are used in order to build this graph:

* X axis is [point]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/journey/web_application/dashboard/attribution/data)

* Y axis is your [value]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/journey/web_application/dashboard/attribution/data)
