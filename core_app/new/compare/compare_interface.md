* **[Admin Header]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/interface/header/header.html):** Located at the top of the interface, this section allows you to manage your account and use cases.
* **[Solutions Header]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/compare/interface/compare_header.html):** A subheader that provides access to solution-specific settings.
* **Sidebar:** Positioned on the left, this menu lets you switch between different Datama solutions.
* **Interface:** This is essentially an interactive dashboard including two main "slides":
    * [Waterfall]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/compare/interface/waterfall.html): waterfall vision of your overall performance variation
    * [Detail View]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/compare/interface/detailed_view.html): A deeper analysis of each step of the waterfall explaining the factors influencing performance changes.
