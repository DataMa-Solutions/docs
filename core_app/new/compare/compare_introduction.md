This analysis is powered by **two key data components** collected from your business:

- **Business Metrics** – Core performance indicators such as revenue, sales volume, number of users impacted by a marketing campaign, and other key figures that define your success.
- **Associated Dimensions** – The contextual attributes that help break down and explain these metrics, such as customer segment, product type, country, vendor, age, gender, device, year, model, and more.


Datama Compare works with first-party data collected directly by your company, whether from your ERP, spreadsheets, or analytics tools like Google Analytics, ContentSquare, and others. It can also integrate third-party data from external sources, such as market reports or public datasets, to enrich the analysis and provide a broader perspective.
