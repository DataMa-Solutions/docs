This analysis is possible thanks to **2 main types** of data collected from your business:

* **Business Metrics data of the company** (revenue, sales volume, number of users impacted by a marketing campaign, etc.)
* and the **dimensions associated** with these volumes (customer segment, type of product sold, country, vendors, age, gender, device, year, models, …)

The data used can be first party data, collected by your company : ERP, Excel spreadsheet or even data collection tools (like Google Analytics, ContentSquare, …)
But it can also come from other third party players, such as market data or public data
