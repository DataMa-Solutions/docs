## Dimension analysis
Identify which dimension in a specific step is driving the change

See details [here]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/compare/model/dimension_analysis.html)

### Mix effect
For each step, analyze how much mix effects on each dimension contributes to the observed gap

See details [here]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/compare/model/dimensions_analysis#mix-effet)


### Segment performance
For each step and each dimension, identify which specific segment performance is driving the observed gap
