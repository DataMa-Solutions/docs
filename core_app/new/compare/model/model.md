## <b>Waterfall analysis</b>
Identify which step of the funnel is driving the change. Better understand how to interprete the waterfall. 

See details [here]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/compare/interface/waterfall.html)

<br>

## <b>Dimension analysis</b>
Identify which dimension in a specific step is driving the change with some details on Mix and Performance effect.

See details here for [Mix Effects]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/compare/model/dimension_analysis_mix.html) and for [performance effects]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/compare/model/dimension_analysis_performance.html)

<br>

### Mix effect
For each step, analyze how much mix effects on each dimension contributes to the observed gap

See details [here]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/compare/model/dimensions_analysis_mix.html)

<br>

### Segment performance
For each step and each dimension, identify which specific segment performance is driving the observed gap

See details [here]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/compare/model/dimensions_analysis_performance.html)
