> **« Detailed View »** allows you to deep dive on each step and each dimension.

![detailed_view]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/compare/interface/images/moves.jpg)

By default, the drop-down menus are selected in both main step and main dimension of your analysis. You can change the selection of either a step or a dimension. Each time you run the calculation, the default selection in the drop-down menu will be reactivated.

The selection is dynamic: selection made on the « Detailed view – filter » will affect the waterfall above.

3 different views are available for this « detailed view »:
* [Moves]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/compare/interface/moves.html)
