> Find here how you can use **Filters**

<br>

The filters menu is composed of 2 main options for each dimension of your dataset:
- Filter some segments in the analysis with one or multiple segments from one or multiple dimensions
- Exclude some dimensions/segments from the explanatory factors.

## 1. Filter a segment

There are two ways to filter a segment : from the settings or from the graph. 


<br>

### 1.1 From the Settings: 
Just click on "Filter" and "Add a new filter" to remove Segment within a given dimension that you want to filter on.

According to your selection, the calculation will re-run automatically.

<br>

### 1.2 From the graph: 

Segment can also be filtered with a right click on the segment in the waterfall. The calculation will re-run automatically.

## 2. Filters options

Select an operator in the filters to refine your searches (by inclusion or exclusion criteria, “contains”, etc.)

## 3. Exclude / Re-include dimension
Dimension (column of your dataset) could be excluded or re-included from the analysis. Click on the cross of the pill to exclude the dimension.

You then need to click on the tick to re-include the dimension.
