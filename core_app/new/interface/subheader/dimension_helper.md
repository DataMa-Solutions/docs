Helper charts can help you to understand what you want to compare and what you have in your data.


## 1. Dimension Helper
The dimension helper helps visualise the start and end point of each dimension at each step of the waterfall.

The graph represents in blue and orange what is selected as a comparison (start and end) in your analysis and in gray the value of the part that are not selected in the scope of your analysis (part of the data filtered or ignored in the start/ end definition).
