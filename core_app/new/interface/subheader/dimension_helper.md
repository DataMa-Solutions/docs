Helper charts can help you to understand what you want to compare and what you have in your data.


## 1. Dimension Helper
The dimension helper helps visualise the start and end point of each dimension at each step of the waterfall.

You can access to Helper by clicking "Expand Comparison configuration" when you land to Compare section.

Change your selection by using the carret in the title of the graph.

The graph represents in blue and orange what is selected as a comparison (start and end) in your analysis and in gray the value of the part that are not selected in the scope of your analysis (part of the data filtered or ignored in the start/ end definition).

> Tip: click on the legend to remove some bars (orange, blue or gray)
