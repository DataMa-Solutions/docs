# 3. Statistics

In Statistics, find a summary of the number of <i>computations</i> made.

You can customize the histogram according to several breakdowns (Total, Solution, workbook) and filter according to the date as well.

> **What's a Computation?**
At Datama, the consumption of the solution is made according to the number of computations, which is the number of times the algorithms are triggered to display new results. This means that when using filters, playing with settings, or saving, this counts a Computation. However, this has no impact on the cost of the solution. Feel free to use the solution as much as you want!
