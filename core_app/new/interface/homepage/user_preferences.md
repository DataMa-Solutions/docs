> **User Preferences**
In order to customize your analysis to your needs, DataMa allows you to save user preferences at Use Case level or at your profile level.
Color palette and default language for example can be modified at both level.

<br/>

## **Analysis Language**


For now, DataMa is only available in English and in French. By default Datama is in english.
- You can change the language for a specific Use Case (Settings > Analysis Language)
- or globally for the whole Use cases (Profile icon > User preferences > Analysis Language)
