## In DataMa Compare

This use case is specifically designed to help category managers analyze category performance using a customized business equation that assesses revenue generation.


Our objective is to evaluate revenue from one year to another for each category based on the following equation:


<span style="color:red"> Revenue = ND (Nb Stores) x (Units/ NbStores) x (Revenue/ Unit) </span>


This equation calculates revenue by considering the number of distribution points (Nb Stores), the average number of units sold per store, and the revenue generated per unit. It enables category managers to better understand the performance of each category in terms of sales volume and revenue generation.

The equation can be further refined by incorporating other variables, such as promotional activities, seasonality, product placement, and more. This additional information will provide category managers with a comprehensive understanding of category performance, empowering them to make informed decisions for optimizing sales and revenue.

## Conclusion 

By conducting a category management performance analysis, businesses can gain valuable insights into sales trends and patterns across various categories, channels, and brands. This information can help the business implement targeted strategies to optimize category management and drive revenue growth.
