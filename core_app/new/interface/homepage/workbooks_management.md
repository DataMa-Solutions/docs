# 1. Workbook


You can access your workbooks from the home page in the "Recent" section or in folders you've created in your workspaces.

The "Recent" section shows the workbooks you've worked on recently. You can edit, delete, or move them to a folder using the contextual menu.

You can also manage your workbooks in the "Workbooks" page.

# 2. Folders

To organize your workbooks, you can create folders in the "Workbooks" page. Simply give the folder a name and an optional icon.
