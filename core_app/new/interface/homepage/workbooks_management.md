On the home page, you can access your workbooks in the “Recent section” or in your workspaces organized with folders. 

In the “Recent” section of the home page, you find the last workwooks you modified. A contextual menu allows you to edit, delete or move them to a specific folder.

You find a similar management of your workwooks in “Workbooks” side navigation menu.
