> This chapter explains how to use the "folders" in the DataMa solution to manage your workbooks.

## <b>**Workbook**</b>


You can access your workbooks from the home page in the "Recent" section or in folders you've created in your workspaces.

The "Recent" section shows the workbooks you've worked on recently. You can edit, delete, or move them to a folder using the contextual menu.

## <b>**Folders**</b>

To organize your workbooks, you can create folders in the "Workbooks" page. Simply give the folder a name and an optional icon.
