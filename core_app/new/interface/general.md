> **Why this page?**  To give you a shared understanding of Datama‚Äôs philosophy, the market equation methodology, and the use cases covered by each solution (Compare, Detect, Pivot, Assess, Journey, Prep).

<br>

# üéØ What is Datama?
Datama helps you analyze performance faster and more reliably by quantifying the drivers of variation (mix, volumes, prices, conversion rates, etc.) and guiding you toward actions with measurable impact.

- **For teams:** data, marketing, product, e-commerce, finance.  
- **Expected outcome:** clear explanations, quantification and faster decisions.

## ‚úÖ When to use which solution?
- *You see a variation (up/down)* ‚Üí Use **Compare** to explain it with a waterfall.  
- *You want to be alerted in case of anomaly* ‚Üí Use **Detect** to spot and track it.  
- *You want to explore segments/ opportunities* ‚Üí Use **Pivot** to dig deeper.  
- *You need to measure significance of a variation* ‚Üí Use **Assess** to quantify impact.  
- *You want to know which step to rebuilt in priority* ‚Üí Use **Journey** to understand paths and drop-offs.  
- *Your want to connect your data to our solutions!* ‚Üí Use **Prep** to make it clean and usable.

# üßÆ Our methodology: the ‚Äúmarket equation‚Äù

<br>

<div class="info-box"> Without this method, you're not just missing insights
you're missing opportunities to grow.</div>

<br>

The goal is to **break down any KPI variation** (e.g. revenue, leads, margin, conversion) into **multiplicative factors**: `volume √ó avg. price √ó ‚Ä¶`  
Then to separate **mix effects** (composition changes) from **true performance effects** (rate, price, conversion at constant mix).

**Core principles:**
- **Factorized decomposition** of KPIs (e.g. `Revenue = Visits √ó Conversion Rate √ó AOV`).  
- **Mix effect**: variation due to changes in composition between segments (countries, channels, devices, products‚Ä¶).  
- **Performance effect**: true improvement/decline at constant segment mix.  
- **Comparability**: across periods, cohorts, audiences (B2B/B2C), channels, or products.

<br>

## üí° Best practices
- Always define a **clear baseline period** (period vs period, vs LY, vs reference).  
- Use a **fixed taxonomy** (channels, devices, products) before comparing.  
- **Disentangle** mix vs performance effects to avoid paradoxes.
