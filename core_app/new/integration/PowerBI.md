# <b>How to use the Datama Extension?</b>

Datama will be basically like a Power BI graph embedded in the visualisation. You will have to configure it as a basic graph adding Dimensions and metrics. 
- the first <i>Dimension</i> will be considered as the Start & End Comparison dimension
- the metrics will be the step of your [market equation]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/interface/subheader/metrics_relation.html) in the order of the metrics. (by default it will be a "prod" equation, this can be changed in the settings: Format your visual > Advanced Settings > Step function)

# <b>How to set up the Datama extension?</b>

- By clicking "Format your visual" and <i>object to display</i>, select the elements your want to view
    - Slide 1 chart 1 is the Waterfall
    - Slide 1 chart 2 is a funnel representation
    - Slide 2 focuses on a specific step with 
        - chart 1 reprensents the mix and performance variations 
        - and chart 2 a waterfall zoomed on a step.


 Advanced settings > 
- **Step function** : Here you can specify the linking function between the step of the waterfall. Default function is "prod" but can be "sum" or custom: e.g. <i>[1]*[2]*(1-[3])</i> which means step 1 is multiplied by step 2 and multiplied by 1-[3]. You can arrange the steps as you want, just make sure, it's still as a business sense!
-  **Main KPI name**: By default, last metrics is the main KPI, but it can be renamed here.
- **Main KPI unit**: Figures will be followed by the unit of the main KPI (â‚¬, %...). In case of percentage, the total will be multiplied by 100.
- **Language**: English or French are currently available for Title and Comments.
