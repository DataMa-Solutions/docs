> Using OpenAi in Datama Solutions to enhance your comments


# 1. Contextualized comments

DataMa generates an analysis and provides sentences that explain variations in KPIs. By leveraging the power of AI, DataMa enhances these explanations with contextualized comments, improving the depth and clarity of the analysis.

## How it works

### 1. Initial comments
DataMa initially processes the raw data to identify and quantify variations in key performance indicators (KPIs).
The system generates insights that explain these variations.

### 2. Integration with OpenAI:
The generated insights are then passed through OpenAI's language model.
OpenAI enhances these narratives by adding contextual insights, ensuring the explanations are comprehensive and tailored to the specific dataset and business context.
