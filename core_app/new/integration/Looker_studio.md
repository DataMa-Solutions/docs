# <b>How to Use the DataMa Extension?</b>

DataMa will be basically like a Looker Studio graph embedded in the visualisation. You will have to configure it as a basic graph.

# <b>How to set up the DataMa extension?</b>

- the first <i>Dimension</i> will be considered as the Start & End Comparison dimension
- the metrics will be the step of your [market equation]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/interface/subheader/metrics_relation.html) in the order of the metrics. (by default it will be a "prod" equation, this can be changed in the settings: Style > DataMa Global Settings)
- Add your licence key in the Settings: Style > DataMa Global Settings > Licence Key
- in <i>object to display</i>, select the elements your want to view. 
- use as many element as you want in your page. 

<br>

> Tip: When you want to compare period: Create a calculated field as a 1st dimension to choose what to put as a Start & End element in this dimension. This calculated field could then be used as Dropdown menu to better select the period you want to compare
