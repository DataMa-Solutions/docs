> Gap analysis in Tableau has never been easier with Datama

Welcome to Datama Documentation. In this page, you will learn how to use the demo version of Datama Compare Extension listed on the [Tableau gallery](https://exchange.tableau.com/en-gb/products/233)

<br>

# 1. Create a source worksheet

In Tableau Desktop, create a new worksheet a source for Datama.

A source worksheet should have all the metrics and dimensions you want to analyse in Datama.
Typically a source for Datama will have
* A set of dimensions in Rows
  - The dimension you want to compare on should come first
  - Note: By default, Datama will compare the last 2 values for discrete dimensions or split in two the dates dimensions. Makes sure to leverage Tableau parameters or filters to get the right comparison.
* A set of metrics in columns
  - Datama sets up a [relation]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/interface/subheader/metrics_relation.html) (product of ratio) among metrics by default. Ensure they're in a "funnel" sequence.
  - Since Tableau provides metrics to Datama in alphabetical order (and not the displayed order), adding a "1_..", "2_.." in the naming of your metrics should help to get the dimensions in the right order. 

Here is an example of a source from The SuperStore default dataset of Tableau.

# 2. Insert the Datama extension in a dashboard

* In Tableau desktop, create a new dashboard 
* Add your source worksheet to this dashboard. The source worksheet should appear as included in the left side panel. Feel free then to make it a floating object and put that in a small corner (it just needs to be there but doesn't need to be seen!)
* Drag and drop 'extension' object in the dashboard and select Datama's extension in the [Tableau Gallery](https://extensiongallery.tableau.com/extensions) 
    - Alternatively download the extension manifest file <a id="download-tableau-full-extension" href="#" target="_blank"> here</a>, you should get a .trex file. Then in Tableau, in the "add an extension" dialog, select "access local extensions" and find the .trex file you just downloaded.

Here is an example of a source from the same dataset as above.
