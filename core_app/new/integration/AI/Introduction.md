> Using OpenAi in Datama Solutions to enhance your comments

<br>

# 1. Contextualized comments

Datama generates an analysis and provides sentences that explain variations in KPIs. By leveraging the power of AI, Datama enhances these explanations with contextualized comments, improving the depth and clarity of the analysis.

<br>

## How it works

### 1. Initial comments
Datama initially processes the raw data to identify and quantify variations in key performance indicators (KPIs).
The system generates insights that explain these variations.

<br>

### 2. Integration with OpenAI:
_The generated insights are then passed through OpenAI's language model._
_OpenAI enhances these narratives by adding contextual insights, ensuring the explanations are comprehensive and tailored to the specific dataset and business context._

<br>

#### Step one : Accept Terms & Conditions of Open Ai
When clicking on the OpenAi button sparkle icon next to comments, you will be prompted to accept OpenAi ToS whenever they change.
You will need to accept those to continue.

<br>

#### Step two : Add some context for OpenAi
In order to make the most of Ai, you need to provide some context on the analysis.
To do so, click on the _[add context]_ button that will display a popup where you can write a context.
This context will be used with OpenAi.

<br>

#### Step three : Generate examples and use them
Click on the generate button to see some examples, and if you are satisfied, accept those by clicking on the "Use this comment"
