DataMa allows you to define units for each step of your metric relations, but also for the result of your market equation. 

These units can be of simple form (ex: $, €, £...), like:

<center><img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/prep/interface/images/prep_unit1.jpg" style="width:1000px;"/></center>



 which will be displayed in the following way: 

<center><img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/prep/interface/images/prep_unit2.jpg" style="width:1000px;"/></center>



You can also define these units using a pattern (ex: $.*M) to make the display more accurate, like :

<center><img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/prep/interface/images/prep_unit3.jpg"/></center>


As shown in the following graphic:
