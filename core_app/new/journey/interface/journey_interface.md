The interface is split in four main parts:

* **Admin Header:** the header of the window manage your account and your use cases
* **Solutions Header:** the subheader of the window manage the settings of the solution
* **Interface:**  essentially the charts you see in the page (split in Attribution, descriptive comparison and Detailed view)
* **Sidebar:** The left part of the web page, which allows you to switch from one solution to another
