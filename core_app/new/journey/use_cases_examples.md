------------------

Datama JOURNEY can be used from a wide variety of use case, from online product analysis to cross-channel customer experience. It basically depends on the data you're putting as an input, which should include a 'Journey' column that gives the touch point with your customer in a sequential order.

In this section you will find some example of data set, but all is up to your creativity (and your capacity to collect and create the data source ;) )

- [Website cross page journeys]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/journey/use_cases_examples/website_cross_page_journeys.html)
- [Website intra page AB test]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/journey/use_cases_examples/website_intra_page_AB_test.html)
- [Online acquisition]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/journey/use_cases_examples/online_acquisition.html)


All the data used in the different use cases are available in [this Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z2JovUx_q7uLR2iy_fukiJWpIrA1o5wfvfnaHQUgBE4/edit#gid=0).
