> **Datama JOURNEY is a data analysis tool that allows you to quickly visualize journeys and simulate attribution models on your customer touch points.**

If you're already familiar with Datama Solutions, Datama JOURNEY is a slightly different animal: the expectations in terms of data source are not the same, nor its minimal size. Main reason is that Datama JOURNEY expects a "Journey" column to be able to analyse Journeys.

This documentation gives you an overview of how it works and how to use it.

<br>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Customer Journey Visualization:</strong> Get a view of your customer's navigation, spotlighting critical interactions.</li>
    <li><strong>Value Attribution:</strong> Assess and allocate value to each touchpoint, giving you insights into high-impact areas.</li>
    <li><strong>Improvement Prioritization:</strong> Utilize data-driven insights to prioritize enhancements, ensuring resources are directed for maximum effect.</li>
</ul>
