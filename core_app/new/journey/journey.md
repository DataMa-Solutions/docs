If you're already familiar with Datama Solutions, Datama JOURNEY is a slightly different animal: the expectations in terms of data source are not the same, nor its minimal size. Main reason is that Datama JOURNEY expects a "Journey" column to be able to analyse Journeys.

This documentation gives you an overview of how it works and how to use it.
