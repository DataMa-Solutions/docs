> **DataMa JOURNEY is a data analysis tool that allows you to quickly visualize user journeys and simulate attribution models on your customer touch points.**

<br>

DataMa JOURNEY allows you to understand your customer experience, using the data you're already collecting.
Ultimately, it will allow you to improve your customer experience through data-driven insights.
More precisely, you will be able to:

* Visualize your customer journey and communicate it in an appealing format (Sunburst)
* Compare your customer journeys between two segments, or two periods
* Understand where the value comes from, and where it's lost, through an attribution model
* Compare touchpoints between one another and see what's under/over performing
