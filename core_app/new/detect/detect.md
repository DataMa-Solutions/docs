> **Datama Detect aims at evaluating over time the normality of a variation and explain it**


This module allows to automate outlier identification on a given ratio, and understand the drivers of that anomaly. This is particularly useful in time series for being able to quickly spot issues in your KPIs overtime.

Datama Detect is a data analysis tool that allows you not only to detect potential outliers in your dataset but also to explain them using the Datama Compare algorithm.

You can use Datama Detect to monitor your dataset and set up automatic monitoring of your main KPIs. If your dataset is big enough, Datama Detect will show you potential outliers as well as give you the opportunity to further investigate your data.

    <li><strong>Daily/ Hourly Anomaly Detection:</strong> Systematically identify unexpected spikes or drops in your metrics.</li>
    <li><strong>Alert Dispatch:</strong> Receive timely alerts, ensuring you never miss a significant deviation in your data.</li>
    <li><strong>Dimensional Scoring:</strong> Dive deep into the root causes, offering you a clear understanding of why an anomaly occurred.</li>
