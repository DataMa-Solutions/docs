Besides the main solution Datama Compare, Detect, Assess, Pivot, and Journey, Datama contains key features such as Calendar, Explore and Prep. In this part, we will explain all these features.

<br>

# 1. Prep

Datama Prep is the first step before using any Datama solution. It’s where you connect, merge, and clean different data sources to create a final, reliable dataset ready for analysis across all Datama tools.

# 2. Calendar
Datama Calendar lets you weave key business activities and events into your existing datasets to uncover their impact—and correlations—on the KPIs you track. It’s fully customizable: integrate anything from public holiday calendars to bespoke operational milestones, all in a way that matches your processes.

# 3. Explore

Datama Explore is a key component for diagnosing where KPI variations originate. It helps you uncover the “why” behind the “what” — providing a detailed, granular view of the factors driving KPI increases or decreases.

As a core feature across all Datama Solutions, it’s displayed at the top of each interface. Here, you can explore KPI evolution across multiple dimensions in your dataset — also known as the “Dimension Helper.”
