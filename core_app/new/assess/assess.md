> **Datama Assess allows you to quickly assess the statistical significance of a difference on any KPI between two points**


The significance of the difference can be assessed between two variants of an AB test, two periods of time, or basically anything you would like to compare. 

A number of alternative statistical tests are proposed. The preferred procedure depends on your data and on the type of question you try to answer.
