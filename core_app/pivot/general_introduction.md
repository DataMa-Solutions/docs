> **DataMa PIVOT** is a dataset analysis tool that allows you to identify and understand the dimensions that have the greatest impact on the performance indicator you want to track

DataMa PIVOT (as well as DataMa COMPARE) analyses is possible thanks to 2 main types of data collected from your business:

* **Business Metrics data of the company** (revenue, sales volume, number of users impacted by a marketing campaign, etc.)
* and the **dimensions associated** with these volumes (customer segment, type of product sold, country, vendors, age, gender, device, year, models, …)
Its data comes from management ERP, Excel spreadsheet or even **data collection tools** (like Google Analytics, ContentSquare, …)
