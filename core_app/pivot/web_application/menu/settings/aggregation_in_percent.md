**Level of aggregation** (<span style="color:red">NumLimit</span>): The level of aggregation that the model is using – e.g. if Level of aggregation is set at X%,  segment within each dimension that represents less than X% of the Primary Numerator (e.g. Revenues) of the main KPI you’re analyzing will be clustered in one « Other » segment. X is set at 2 by default, but you may want to play with this parameter quite a bit because it can change significantly the calculation of mix effects.
