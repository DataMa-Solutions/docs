## Scheduler

### What is Datama scheduler
When enabled, the scheduler will allow you to pre-compute making DataMa Analysis faster.

It's a good practice to use schedulers when you have a scheduled export (on slack or by email etc...) because it'll pre-compute your data and the analysis will be faster.

Also a good practice to keep in mind is that when you crunch huge datasets, use the scheduler to help optimize your compute and your analysis

### Enabling scheduler flow compute

To pre-compute your flow, just enable the scheduler and select the frequency, and that's it !
