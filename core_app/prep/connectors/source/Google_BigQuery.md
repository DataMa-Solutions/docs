When opening the BigQuery block you can see which Google account is connected and you can disconnect it if you want to use another one.

After selecting a project you are able to write a query in the project.

You can also choose to reuse a query that you have already made before using the "query history" button.

When you have typed your query it is checked to see if it is valid or not.

It is then displayed the amount of data it will use in Google BigQuery.
