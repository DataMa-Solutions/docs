* **Saving Name:** name of the use case
* **Set as default when opening […]:** this use case will be loaded at the opening of the solution
* **Keep info on your saving :** the information text will appear when loading the use case. It could be useful for multiple users connect with the same account.
* **Dynamic saving of Start & End:** If selected DataMa will consider Start & End as a dynamic input and will automatically update the data and try to maintain the gap between Start & End. As for example, if Start is week 4 and End is week 6, when opening DataMa 2 weeks later, the Start will be week 6 and End will be week 8.
* **Use decreasing order:** This function is linked to dynamic saving, when you Start & End dimension are numbers DataMa will consider them in decreasing order or increasing order depending on the selection of this checkbox

> **Tip:** In a normal DataMa License you can save up to 10 use cases. If you’ve reached the max amount of use case, you can remove some of them in the « Manage Version » menu
