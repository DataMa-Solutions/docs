# Marketing Campaign

> This page details the **« Marketing – Campaign »**  example in our [demo](https://solutions.datama.fr/) solution.

Read our [article](https://datama.fr/fr/2019/04/11/comment-analyser-lefficacite-dune-campagne-demailing-2/) to better understand emailing campaign analysis

This use case is a basic example of a conversion funnel used for an email campaign. In this use case, DataMa Compare will compare 2 different campaigns and identify the performance at each step of the two campaigns to understand the cause of variation between the two.

**For example:** At this step : the performance of number of emails « Open/Sent » collapsed mainly due to Segment 2, which opened fewer emails in Campaign B than in Campaign A. (This can be seen from the red bar in the middle)
