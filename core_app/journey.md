> **DataMa JOURNEY is a data analysis tool that allows you to quickly visualize user journeys and simulate attribution models on your customer touch points.**

If you're already familiar with DataMa Solutions, DataMa JOURNEY is a slightly different animal: the expectations and minimum size of the data source are not the same. This is primarily because DataMa JOURNEY expects a "Journey" column to be able to analyse Journeys.

This documentation gives you an overview of how it works and how to use it.

Hope you enjoy it.
