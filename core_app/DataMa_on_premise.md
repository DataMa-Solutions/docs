> DataMa could be packaged and installed on premise.

The straightest way of using DataMa certainly to use the solution in a [Web browser](https://app.datama.io/), hosted on our servers or on premise.


However, you could also use DataMa package as a brick within a data flow that performs the task on the defined inputs and renders a flat file or a HTML object that can be consumed by other applications, in particular visualisation software, such as [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) or [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com). See more details in the [extension]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/integrations.html) part 

In that sense, DataMa works well as a step of data science platforms like [DataIku](https://www.dataiku.com/) or [Alteryx](https://www.alteryx.com/).
