3. Click on « Copy url »

![export_url]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/old/header/export_results/images/export_url.gif)

Each graph has also his own icon to be extracted independently:

<center><img src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/old/header/export_results/images/share_graph.png"/></center>

You can then use this URL to embed the chart in any tool, to expose the insights to other users.
Below is an example in Google Data Studio:

![extract_graph]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/old/header/export_results/images/ShareSimpleApp-Compare_GIF2.gif)
