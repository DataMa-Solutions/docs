The Pareto tab is a graph allowing you to the first 10 journeys contributing to a selected metric, and the share of total metric that it represent, as well as the cumulated share of selected metric of top X journeys.

You will be able to quickly identify the steps representing the highest volumes thanks to our decreasing ranking.

Two parameters are used in order to build this graph:

* X axis is % of the metric you have chosen

* Y axis is [point]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/old/journey/web_application/dashboard/attribution/data)

**Example:**

![pareto]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/old/journey/web_application/dashboard/descriptive_comparison/images/pareto.png)
