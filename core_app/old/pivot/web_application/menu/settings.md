DataMa Pivot include a series of parameters in the left menu, that you may have to use to refine or better visualise your analysis.

Most of them are editable through Shiny Web App, but you can also edit them through R code with references below (by those who have a « develop » license)

See articles below to have more details:

* [Tree depth]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/old/pivot/web_application/menu/settings/tree_depth)
* [Aggregation in %]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/old/pivot/web_application/menu/settings/aggregation_in_percent)
* [Continuous clustering depth]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/old/pivot/web_application/menu/settings/continuous_clustering_depth)
