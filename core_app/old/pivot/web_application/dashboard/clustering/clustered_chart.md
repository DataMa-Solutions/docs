The bars show for each element of a dimension the contribution of this element to the global performance (primary numerator). You can change your dimension using the drop-down menu on the right.

The black line is the average KPI of this element (ratio: numerator / denominator)

### Aggregation:

* For non-continuous elements, a cluster is created aggregating the element having a similar average KPI and representing less than “Aggregation in %” (see in the [Settings menu]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/old/pivot/web_application/menu/settings))
* For continuous elements, multiple clusters are created aggregating elements having a similar average KPI.
