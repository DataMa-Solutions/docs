## Ratio view

The Ratio view displays the value of each ratio defined as steps in your [metric relation]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/header/input/metric_relation?id=metric-relation)
The ratio defined by the Primary Numerator and Denominator appears in orange (if matching)
Note that you can skip/ merge some ratios using the [included steps]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/compare/web_application/menu/included_steps) setting in DataMa Compare.
> This chart should help you understand which ratio is high/ low relative to others, so that you can focus on analysing the right one

## Numerator view

The Numerator view displays the value of the numerator for each ratio defined as steps in your [metric relation]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/header/input/metric_relation?id=metric-relation)
The ratio defined by the Primary Numerator appears in orange (if matching)
Note that all numerators appear on the same Y-scale. This only makes sense when units are the same for the numerators
> This chart is particularly helpful to materialize a funnel analysis, where all numerators are comparable and are in fact users reaching different steps of the funnel
