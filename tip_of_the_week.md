# Tips of the week !



<h2>Tip of the week #36</h2>

📢 Lots of new stuff on the platform this week!  You have the full list [here](https://datama-solutions.github.io/docs/#/news).

 In particular, a great news for analysts whose beautiful graphs always end up in slides (we know some of them 😅 ): you can now download all DataMa graphs and comments on PowerPoint in one click.  Just click on the "ppt" icon on the top right of the graph. 

Boom 💥

![Tip 36](images/36.gif)



<h2>Tip of the week #34</h2>

Whether in Tableau or PowerBi, transparently display your DataMa graphs  🤓
* DataMa directly retrieves your data in your dataViz tool
* You only need 3 tabs in Tableau:
 * 1 for data
 * 1 for DataMa configuration
 * 1 to make a beautiful dashboard

Find more information on our online [documentation](https://datama-solutions.github.io/docs//#/general/admin/create_use_case/extensions/extension_tableau?id=tableau-extension) ! 📕

<h2>Tip of the week #33</h2>

Again, another release this week 🎉 ! 

Within the [news](https://datama-solutions.github.io/docs/#/news), the ability to visualize ratios of your 'market equation' side by side.

 For instance, the click through rate of each page of a funnel on the same bar chart   📊

Named 'Ratio helper', this visualisation is useful to know which ratio is under/ over performing even before trying to understand the drivers in Pivot. 

You can see it by clicking on the ➗   in the settings.

To learn more, click [here](https://datama-solutions.github.io/docs/#/general/menu/ratio_helper).

<h2>Tip of the week #32</h2>

🤔  We often try to improve what drives its performance downwards rather than showing what is already going well ... and that's why we have implemented the functionality: Negative drivers first: ↘️ !! 
* By activating this feature in the settings in the left menu, the solution will display as a priority for each step the segments that are driving the performance down
* This feature comes in handy when you have a growing stage, a lot of different segments, and you would like to focus on the ones that have gone down rather than seeing the ones that are doing well.
* We also take the opportunity to redo the scoring of the dimensions by looking first at the dimensions whose segments best explain the decrease (even for the increasing stages)

![Tip 32](images/32.gif)



<h2>Tip of the week #30</h2>

🚒 Following the events at OVH, here is some information on the situation of DataMa hosting:
* 		Being hosted at OVH, we were impacted by the shutdown of services following the Strasbourg fire, but ultimately without much consequence because we were able to switch the solution to other servers in Europe.
* 		A few hours after the shutdown, everything was back to normal, the backups worked fine, everything was restored on solutions.datama.fr 🤓
* 		We even took the opportunity to increase the power of the platform. 🚀
* 		Do not hesitate to come back to us if you have any access problem.
* 		Thank you for your understanding and again sorry for the inconvenience.

<h2>Tip of the week #29</h2>

🆕 Multiple [news](https://datama-solutions.github.io/docs/#/news) on DataMa this week, including some great features.
Within them, "right click"  🖱 on DataMa Compare waterfall is now available. You can easily decide to:

* Zoom on a given step to see the details of a dimension (left click equivalent)
* Skip (collapse) a step in the funnel
* Filter/ Exclude a given segment
* Change breakdown dimension
* Show more segments in a dimension

Your turn to test it!

![Tip 29](images/29.png)



<h2>Tip of the week #28</h2>

Afraid of explaining what's a mix effect in that meeting with the DataMa Waterfall 😨 ? 

Good news, you don't need to show it. Just de-activate the split between mix and perf in the settings. DataMa will then group the two effects and just show negative and positive total variations instead.

![Tip 28](images/28.png)



<h2>Tip of the week #27</h2>

 DataMa Pivot now has its own smart comment 📝!  You can find your insights in bullet points under each chart of DataMa Pivot, as if an analyst would have work to get what you need!

 This new feature is part of a set of releases from this week that you can see on https://datama-solutions.github.io/docs/#/news 

Enjoy 😄

<h2>Tip of the week #26</h2>

 The DataMa team wish you a happy new year 🎉 !  In case you want to filter out and forget this 2020 year 😷 from your analysis, we have what you need... with the new filter interface you can, in 2 clics:

* ✔️ select segments that you want to keep
* ❎ exclude a dimension from analysis using left button
* Combine the two previous points

The launch the calculations by hitting the button at bottom left  ('Enter' shortcut on your keyboard)

<h2>Tip of the week #22</h2>

A quick - yet not dirty - analysis from a spreadsheet into DataMa?  

✂️  Just copy the cell range (Ctrl+C) and paste it straight in DataMa (Ctrl + V).

Easy enough?

![Tip 22](images/22.gif)



<h2>Tip of the week #21</h2>

When you save an analysis in DataMa, and if that analysis is linked to a "live" source (e.g. a Gsheet), DataMa suggests to save the "Start" and "End" settings as dynamic.

Although that might look a little technical 🤓, this feature is quite useful for recurring analysis, because it allows to automatically adjust the time window 🗓. 

For instance:
* At time t,  you have in your data source a "Week" column with possible values week 24, week 25 or week 26.
* Still at time t, in DataMa COMPARE you're comparing  week 25 to week 26 . You save this use case dynamically. DataMa records that it is the last 2 values in the alphabetical order that you want to get in your comparison
* Now, at time t+1, your data is updated with one additional week. Now in your "Week" column you have week 24, week 25, week 26 and week 27.
* DataMa will now automatically update your comparison (in the app, but also in your exports, by email, slack etc), taking the last 2 values in the aphabetical order. So you will move the comparison automatically to week 26 vs week 27

➡️ Therefore your analysis keeps up to date in a automated way, without having to change the settings 🤙!

<h2>Tip of the week #20</h2>

Because September has just passed and we've been working hard all summer, the new backtoschool version 🎒 of DataMa is available in production! 

On the agenda:

* Dynamic Google Analytics connector
* Extension of shareable widgets on viz tools 
* Bootsrap test in DataMa Impact
* DataMa Journey UI redesign and performance improvement
* Interactive table in Compare
* and many more listed here: https://datama-solutions.github.io/docs//#/news

Thanks to all contributors for their ideas and your constant feedback on the tool! 

Stay tune, there's a lot more to come... 🚀

<h2>Tip of the week #19</h2>

 When we analyze a variation via DataMa COMPARE, we sometimes need to check its significance 🧐

* DataMa COMPARE gives you the size of the effect also called amplitude of the effect 🌊
* and DataMa IMPACT will give you the combination with the power analysis (which ensures that the impact reaches a sufficient number of individuals) 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦

To find this combination of amplitude and power analysis you can of course use DataMa IMPACT, but also within DataMa COMPARE, where you also find the Significance Test functionality. A very useful feature when you want to ensure the interest of the variation that you observe! 💥
￼

<h2>Tip of the week #18</h2>

 In case you're getting bored at the beach 🏖, we have what you need: DataMa documentation 📖 ...

 ➡️ 🔗 [here](https://datama-solutions.github.io/docs/#/) is you're best summer read!

And as we acknowledge that we sometimes don't manage to keep up with the crazy pace of releases in the product, we've made you able to contribute on each page and suggest your own modifications by clicking on the "Edit document" link at the top of the page ✍️

<h2>Tip of the week #17</h2>

As an analyst, we often try to analyse the performance of a segment compared to the rest (for example the performance of the Mobile compared to other devices) ... DataMa has just implemented a new feature that does just that! 🤓

* When you filter on a particular segment, you now have access to the "Display other segments" function just under the filter,
* This function will show as main information in the waterfall chart the segment that you have isolated and behind it, the variation of the other segments.

Very practical when you don't want to open 2 windows on your computer to compare variations between them 😉

<h2>Tip of the week #16</h2>

You don't have time to open the DataMa interface ... receive your analyses directly in your mailbox or on a Slack channel 📨

* By using the menu "export result" you can schedule for you or your boss an export directly to a mailbox at the frequency you want. 💡
￼
Tip: as seen above you can just as easily share your DataMa graphs in a Data Studio (or others) and configure the sending of emails from your data viz tool!

<h2>Tip of the week #14</h2>

In the new features released during the containment, we find the functionality: Export graph as public URL :bar_chart:

All graphs from DataMa solutions can now be exported to your Tableau, Data Studio dashboards... or to your web browser!

This allows you to enrich your usual reporting with DataMa charts:

* In DataMa, at the top right of each graph, select the icon: "Export Graph as public URL"
* Authorise the rights to share this secure URL
* Then use this URL as a block "URL" in your usual data visualisation tool and voila!

The data in this new widget is constantly updated with the data loaded into DataMa.

**Note:** This feature is enabled on demand, contact us if you want to enable this feature.


<h2>Tip of the week #13</h2>

When you want to use DataMa, you often wonder about the data... 💻

How do I connect my data into DataMa? How do I get my data (and therefore my charts) updated as I go? One of the solutions...is Google spreadsheet!  💡

* In Google Spreadsheet, you can, thanks to the extensions available in the solution, connect any data source (here for example Google analytics)
* Once in DataMa, by creating a new Use Case from the URL of the Gsheet, you can specify (by checking the box: Keep Live connection with Gsheet) that you want the data to be automatically updated....
* And that's it...

You can also use other extensions such as "OWOX BI BigQuery" for your BigQuery queries or the "Supermetrics" add-on for connection to all other applications on the market!


<h2>Tip of the week #12</h2>

🆕 New header has been released on the platform !

Not only it makes admin functions (new data source, export etc) easier and more intuitive to access, but it also adds some cool features:

* Switch between DataMa Solutions (Compare, Impact, Pivot, Journey...) in the same page  🔄
* See if workbook has been saved or not easily with workbook name at top of page
* Quickly save under same name (with "Save" on top of "Save As")

Happy to have your feedbacks while testing it!

**Note:** this new header replaces the "Admin" menu that used to be at bottom left of the page

![Tip 12](images/12.gif)

<h2>Tip of the week #11</h2>

In these troubled times 😷, you have some of your data that is "non-comparable" in your DataMa Compare analysis (like a distribution channel... that no longer exists 😕!), but you still want it to appear separately in your Waterfall, to only compare your KPIs on comparable things (🍎 to 🍎)?

➢ Create a 'Scope' column with 'In' for what you want to keep or 'Out' for what you want to exclude

➢ DataMa will automatically exclude the "Out" from the analysis and make it appear in a separate block of the waterfall, in light blue "Out of Scope"

See a concrete example [ici](https://www.docs.datama.fr/docs/datama-compare/general-introduction/use-cases-examples/marketing-campaign/marketing-campaign-scope/) !

Prepared with ❤️ from home, we think of you and accompany you on all your subjects from a distance!

 ![Tip 11](images/11.png)

<h2>Tip of the week #10</h2>

When using DataMa COMPARE to compare two time periods. You can set up the solution so that your analyses in DataMa are always up-to-date with your latest data. 🏃♀️

All you need to do is:

1. Load a new source ("Change source" menu) via a "Google Sheet".
2. Then select the option "Keep Live connection with Gsheet".
3. Once the analysis is in place, you must save the use case by leaving the option "Dynamic saving of Start & End" selected. Be careful that the dates used as Start and End exist in the dataset!
4. From the interval used for Start and End (1st week compared to the 4th week of the dataset for example), DataMa will reproduce this same interval according to the last existing data...

Once your data updates itself, all you have to do is set up a regular send to your mailbox or a Slack channel and you're done!

![Tip 10](images/10.gif)

<h2>Tip of the week #9</h2>

To speed up your analysis we have accelerated the loading of your data. 🚀

In DataMa, you can now:

* Copy & paste your Excel tables or Gsheet URLs.
* drag & drop your data files (excel, csv).

DataMa recognizes the source directly and offers you to launch the analysis directly!

To find out more:


<h2>Tip of the week #8</h2>

You can now use DataMa as a Tableau extension ➕ !

You drag and drop the extension provided by DataMa into your Tableau dashboard, and you access from DataMa the data viewed in a Tableau worksheet.

Not only is your data up-to-date with what you already have in Tableau, but your filters and other actions in Tableau are then active in DataMa! 🔄

![Tip 8](images/8.gif)

For more information: https://www.docs.datama.fr/docs/extensions/tableau-extension/


<h2>Tip of the week #7</h2>

* Did you know that all you had to do was press the "Enter" shortcut ️ in your keyboard to update the calculations in DataMa?

* Now yes 🙂

![Tip 7](images/7.png)

<h2>Tip of the week #6</h2>


Lost in DataMa :question:

In addition to the documentation, there is now a tutorial that interactively guides you through your first steps on the app 👣

* Click on "Launch tutorial" at the top right of the screen to get you started! 🧗♂️

![Tip 6](images/6.png)

<h2>Tip of the week #5</h2>

You can easily filter your analyses in DataMa on a part of your source dataset.

* Simply exclude an entire dimension from the analysis using "Excluded Dimension". DataMa will no longer report this dimension as the one that can explain the variation in your performance, but this does not change the total performance you are explaining.
* Filter on only part of your data by using the filters, selecting the dimension and then the segment(s) of that dimension to keep. You can filter on two dimensions at the same time (Level 1 and Level 2). These filters will appear in the titles of your graphs for more context.


<h2>Tip of the week #4</h2>

As you know, in order to explain your overall performance variation, DataMa independently analyses for each stage each of your dimensions to bring up those that best explain the variation in that stage. But the tool also analyses combinations of dimensions. Either all dimensions combined together (Combined Dimensions) or all pairs of dimensions (Smart Dimension). 👨🔬

* The Combined Dimension is enabled by default but the Smart Dimension option must be enabled in the Settings menu.
* Once enabled, the Smart Dimension function will identify for each step, the best dimension combination. When a pair of dimensions makes more sense for your variation than a single dimension it will be displayed with an "x" sign between the 2 selected dimensions. 💑
* The combination chosen by the Smart Dimension function is available in the different graphics of the tool.


<h2>Tip of the week #3</h2>

In all DataMa solutions, you have the possibility to group together elements of a dimension that represents almost nothing on your performance. 🧐

* In the Settings menu, the "aggregation in %" bar corresponds to the level of aggregation you can choose. This allows you to group together items that represent less than 2%, 3%, 4%...of the total of your overall indicator. (By default DataMa aggregates what represents less than 2% of the total)

* This functionality corresponds to the mention "Other (<2% ot the total)" that you can often find in the charts!

Useful especially when your data has dimensions with hundreds of different values.


<h2>Tip of the week #2</h2>

In DataMa Compare and Impact, you can preview the definition of "Start" and "End" using "Overview chart"

* Click on the small graph icon to the right of the Start & End Dimension
* The bars represent the metric you are trying to track. Blue is 'Start', orange is 'End', grey is 'other', neither Start nor End
* The "Overview summarize" tab allows you to have an aggregated view

Useful in particular if you are not sure of what you want to compare!
