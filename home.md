The Home page shows all your workbooks and workflows.

A workbook is a DataMa analysis, which can be used on one or multiple DataMa solutions. Each workbook is linked to a dataset.

You can create a new workbook by clicking the '+' card in the top left corner, or jump into a previously saved workbook from here.

You can also edit the name or description of a workbook, remove it, or lock it from here.

Locking a workbook prevents from accidentally editing or deleting workbooks.
