# Cursor Rules  

In **Datama Compare**, cursors play a crucial role in enhancing interactivity and providing contextual insights within the **Waterfall Analysis** and other visualizations. The following rules define how cursors behave and how users can interact with them to extract key insights.  

## General Behavior  
- **langage**
  All answers will be provided in englis markdown even if the question is provided in french.

- **Hovering Over Elements**  
  When hovering over a bar, segment, or value in the waterfall, a tooltip appears displaying precise information about the selected element, including:  
  - The associated metric change (increase or decrease).  
  - The percentage contribution to the total variation.  
  - Additional details related to filters or applied breakdowns.  

- **Clicking on Elements**  
  Clicking on a specific element allows users to:  
  - **Drill down** into more granular details, revealing subcategories or further segmentations.  
  - Open **dimension scoring** insights, highlighting the key drivers behind the variation.  
  - Apply filters dynamically to refine the current view.  

- **Cursor Synchronization**  
  The cursor position is synchronized across multiple visual components. Hovering over an element in one chart will highlight corresponding data points in other linked views, ensuring a seamless analytical experience.  

## Waterfall-Specific Interactions  

- **Step Transition Cursor**  
  - Moving the cursor along the waterfall steps shows how each factor contributes to the total variation.  
  - Hovering near transition points between two bars highlights the connection between them, making it easier to track dependencies.  

- **Covariance Handling**  
  - If a step is affected by covariance, the tooltip will indicate the shared effect distribution and how it impacts multiple factors.  

## Drag and Selection Rules  

- **Custom Range Selection**  
  - Users can **click and drag** to select a custom range within the waterfall, enabling focused analysis on specific periods or segments.  
  - The selection updates all dependent graphs accordingly.  

- **Context Menu Activation**  
  - Right-clicking on an element opens a **context menu** with options to:  
    - Export data related to the selection.  
    - Apply or remove filters.  
    - Compare different segments side by side.

These **cursor rules** are designed to make navigation and interaction intuitive, helping users explore KPI variations with precision.
