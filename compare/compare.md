## What we are trying to answer?

![What we are trying to answer](images/What-are-we-trying-to-answer.jpg)

This analysis is possible thanks to **2 main types** of data collected from your business:

* **Business Metrics data of the company** (revenue, sales volume, number of users impacted by a marketing campaign, etc.)
* and the **dimensions associated** with these volumes (customer segment, type of product sold, country, vendors, age, gender, device, year, models, …)

Its data comes from management ERP, Excel spreadsheet or even **data collection tools** (like Google Analytics, ContentSquare, …)
