# Dimensions (Mix & Perf)

> **Dimensions and metrics** are the two elements coming from your data that allow **DataMa COMPARE** to properly work.

DataMa COMPARE analyses the contribution of each dimension in the performance and split this contribution in **performance effect** and **mix effect**.

The below diagram helps you to understand the type of contribution we are analyzing when the performance evolves.

In another way, Mix effect is the impact due to the change of proportion in entrance.

As in the example below, when your proportion of Purchase between Device change, that automatically change your Average Basket. In 2018 70% of purchase was in average at 35€ when it’s only 50% in 2019.

* If the proportion change it’s a **Mix effect**
* If the average price change, it’s a **Performance effect**
