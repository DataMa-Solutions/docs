The straightest way of using Datama is to use the solution in a [Web App]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app.html), hosted on our servers as a SaaS ([solutions.Datama.fr](https://solutions.Datama.fr/)).

The web app is split into two main windows:
* A Home page, that represents your saved workbook, and also gives you some inspiration for use cases. [Home]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/home.html)
* The workbook page, which is where you will spend most of your time, and where you'll find insights and settings [Workbook]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app.html)
