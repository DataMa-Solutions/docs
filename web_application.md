# Web application

> DataMa easier usage is in a DataMa application.

The straightest way of using DataMa is to use the solution in a [Web App](general/general.md), hosted on our servers as a SaaS ([solutions.datama.fr](https://solutions.datama.fr/)).

The web app is split into two main pages
* A Home page, that present you saved workbook, and also gives you some inspiration for use cases. [Home](/home/home.md)
* The workbook page, which is where you will spend most of you time, and where you find insights and settings [Workbook](general/general.md)
