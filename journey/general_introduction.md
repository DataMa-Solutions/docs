> **DataMa JOURNEY is a data analysis tool that allows you to quickly visualize journeys and simulate attribution models on journeys' steps.**
  
DataMa JOURNEY (as well as DataMa COMPARE and PIVOT) analyses is possible thanks to 2 main types of data collected from your business:

* **Business Metrics data of the company** (revenue, sales volume, number of users impacted by a marketing campaign, etc.)
* and the **dimensions associated** with these volumes (customer segment, type of product sold, country, vendors, age, gender, device, year, models, …)
Its data comes from management ERP, Excel spreadsheet or even **data collection tools** (like Google Analytics, ContentSquare, …)
