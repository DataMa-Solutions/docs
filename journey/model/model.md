# Model

A pre-requisite is to be able to generate a data source that contains your customer journeys, the volume and the value associated to it.
A customer journey is essentially a set of touch points, in a sequential order, e.g. 'touch point 1 - touch point 2 - touch point 3'
Touch points could be any experience or even process you would like to analyse. See use case section to get inspired
