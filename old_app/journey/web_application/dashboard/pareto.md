# Pareto

The Pareto tab is a graph allowing you to the first 10 journeys contributing to a selected metric, and the share of total metric that it represent, as well as the cumulated share of selected metric of top X journeys.

You will be able to quickly identify the steps representing the highest volumes thanks to our decreasing ranking.

Two parameters are used in order to build this graph:

* X axis is % of the metric you have chosen

* Y axis is [point](journey/web_application/dashboard/data.md)

**Example:**
