By default, the drop-down menus are selected in both main step and main dimension of your analysis. You can change the selection of either a step or a dimension. Each time you run the calculation, the default selection in the drop-down menu will be reactivated.

The selection is dynamic: selection made on the « Detailed view – filter » will affect the waterfall above.
