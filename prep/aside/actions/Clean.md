**Clean action allow you to edit order and types of your columns.**

## What does it mean and how to use it?
### Add action
You can adapt your dataset and transform it in the right format so that its lines and columns concur with other datasets.

In the action menu, you can select the "Clean" option to use it.

### Configure

Select the new clean action, and now you can change the order of your dimensions (and create a better market equation), the name of your columns and the format of your cells (letters, numbers, floats or a mix of them). You can also delete some dimensions by clicking on the cross next to it.


#### Why is it useful ? 
Because you might need to append later on this dataset with another one and you will have to coordinate both of their characteristics (such as the name of the metrics and dimensions, their format etc) so that they match in your dataflow afterwards. This is necessary to create a functionnal and interesting market equation, which is the foundation of DataMA's solutions.
