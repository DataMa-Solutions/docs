## 5. Getting started

Once you've imported the extension, here is how you can use it.

**1. First think at your use case**: You need first to consider which KPI you want to analyse and what are the steps that lead to the main KPI.

**2. Add the viz extension to your worksheet**

**3. Pick your data**:

Choose and drag and drop columns into Comparison or Dimensions or Metrics blocks.

Typically, a source for Datama will have
* A set of dimensions in Rows
    - The dimension you want to compare on should come first
    - Note: By default, Datama will compare the last 2 values for discrete dimensions or split in two the dates dimensions. Makes sure to leverage Tableau parameters or filters to get the right comparison.
* A set of metrics in columns
    - Datama sets up a [relation]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/interface/subheader/metrics_relation.html) (product of ratio) among metrics by default. Ensure they're in a "funnel" sequence.
    - Since Tableau provides metrics to Datama in alphabetical order (and not the displayed order), adding a "1_..", "2_.." in the naming of your metrics should help to get the dimensions in the right order.

Here is an example of a source from The SuperStore default dataset of Tableau.

## 6. Read your Analysis

- **Performance Overview**: Each blue bar represents the performance of your main KPI, using your chosen comparison dimension. helping you quickly gauge performance across different segments.
- **Intermediary Step Analysis**: Intermediary steps depict the ratio evolution of your KPI. The impact is quantified in the units of your main KPI, allowing for a consistent measurement of progress or regression.
- By default, the most interesting dimension will be selected for this zoomed step. You can change the selected dimension for this zoomed step by changing right clicking on the boxes of a segment and select the appropriate dimension in the "split by". You can unzoom by clicking on other steps or clicking on the box again.
- **In-Depth Exploration**: By interacting with a step‚Äîsimply click on it‚Äîyou'll delve into the underlying dimensions that are most influential in explaining your performance variances at each stage of your funnel.
