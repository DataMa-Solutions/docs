    * Comparison "C" dimension (the dimension on which you want to compare, typically Year, Months, or Variant of AB test for instance)
        * Note: By default, Datama will compare the last 2 values for discrete dimensions or split in two the dates dimensions. Makes sure to leverage Tableau parameters or filters to get the right comparison.
    * Dimensions "D" dimensions (the dimensions that will be used to explain the variation of each KPI)
    * Metrics "M" fields (the metrics that will be used to create your market equation for instance Quantity and Sales to create Sales = Qty x Avg Price)
        * Datama sets up a [relation]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/interface/subheader/metrics_relation.html) (product of ratio) among metrics by default. Ensure they're in a "funnel" sequence.
