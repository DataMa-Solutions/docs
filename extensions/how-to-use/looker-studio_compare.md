## 5. Getting started

Once you've imported the extension, here is how you can use it.

**1. First think about your use case**: You need first to consider which KPI you want to analyse and what are the steps that lead to the main KPI.

**2. Prepare your dataset**: 4 steps are needed to properly set your dataset.
1.  **Main KPI:** Define the main KPI you want to compare (e.g. Revenue, Leads, Margin...)
2.  **Comparison Dimensions**: Define on which elements you want to compare your KPI (e.g. Period: Compare Month over Month, Country: Compare one country to the other...)
     - by default, Datama will select the first two elements of your dimension, or split a date range in two.
3.  **Steps**: Define the steps that correspond to the funnel that lead to your main KPI. For example (eCommerce funnel, or Finance funnel) [See dataset examples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bNEeqm5CfpPmYPr_t4ff1xcJkSBKoVvwJd4vKB0sDzs/edit#gid=763618483)
     - To better define your steps (or metric equation), you can read our dedicated [article](https://datama.io/how-to-build-my-business-metric-relation/).
4.  **Explanation dimensions**: Add Dimensions that will be used to explain the variations of your performance. Each variation will have an interest score to see how important they are to explain your variations.

<br/>

**3. Custom settings**: Click on the "Settings" icon on the top right corner of Datama's widget. You can adjust the methodology for comparison explanation and define which metric you want to analyse in the market equation pane

**4. [Paid user only] Save settings**: Once you are happy with your settings, in the Looker studio side panel, in the "Style" tab, paste the JSON automatically added to your clipboard in the "Config JSON" field. 

<center><img style="width:70%;" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/extensions/assets/gif/Jsonsave.gif" /></center>

**5. [Paid user only] Leave edit mode**: In the Looker Studio side panel, in the "Style" tab, untick the "Edit mode" toggle. Dashboard viewers won't see the top header and footer anymore, for a smoother experience.

<br/>

<div class="info-box">
<strong> Tip:</strong> When you want to compare period: Create a calculated field as a 1st dimension to choose what to put as a Start & End element in this dimension. This calculated field could then be used as Dropdown menu to better select the period you want to compare
</div>

<br/>

## 6. Read your Analysis

- **Performance Overview**: Each blue bar represents the performance of your main KPI, using your chosen comparison dimension. helping you quickly gauge performance across different segments.
- **Intermediary step analysis**: Intermediary steps depict the ratio evolution of your KPI. The impact is quantified in the units of your main KPI, allowing for a consistent measurement of progress or regression.
- By default, the most interesting dimension will be selected for this zoomed step. You can change the selected dimension for this zoomed step by changing right clicking on the boxes of a segment and select the appropriate dimension in the "split by". You can unzoom by clicking on other steps or clicking on the box again.
- **In-Depth exploration**: By interacting with a step‚Äîsimply click on it‚Äîyou'll delve into the underlying dimensions that are most influential in explaining your performance variances at each stage of your funnel.
