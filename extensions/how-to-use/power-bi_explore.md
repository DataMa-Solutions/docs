# 1. Overview

# 2. Features

- **1. Dimension and second breakdown:** Datama Explore lets you break down every metric in your dataset across any available dimension. You can also drill down dimension-by-dimension: for instance, start by breaking down product sales by Country in D1. If you want to focus on the UK, you can then introduce a second breakdown dimension in D2—such as Channel, Device, or any other available dimension—to refine the analysis.
<br>

- **2. Second metric:** Datama Explore also supports comparing two KPIs side by side. Simply add a second metric in M2. For example, you can define M1 = Sessions and M2 = ABV to visualize how the two metrics evolve across your chosen dimensions.
<br/>

- **3. Comparison dimension:** When you set a comparison dimension—e.g., Device—and compare two segments such as Tablet vs. Mobile on the Sessions KPI, Datama Explore automatically builds a comparison dimension. This new dimension aggregates the metric values by the selected segments, including Mobile, Tablet, and any other device category.

- **4. KPI change in Absolute value or Percentage:** For comparisons between segments or between time periods, Datama Explore allows you to show the variations either as absolute differences or as percent changes, depending on the format that best fits your analysis.
