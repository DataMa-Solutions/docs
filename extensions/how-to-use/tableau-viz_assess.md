    * Comparison "C" dimension (the dimension on which you want to compare, typically Variant of AB test for instance)
        * Note: By default, Datama will compare the last 2 values for discrete dimensions or split in two the dates dimensions. Makes sure to leverage Tableau parameters or filters to get the right comparison.
    * Metrics "M" fields (the metrics that will be used to create the KPIs you want to assess. Those should be summable. For instance, if you want to assess the significance of user conversion variation, you should add a "User" and a "Purchase" metrics)
        * Datama sets up a [relation]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/core_app/new/interface/subheader/metrics_relation.html) (product of ratio) among metrics by default.
