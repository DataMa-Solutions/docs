## 4. Getting Started

Once you've imported the extension, here is how you can use it.

**1. First think at your use case**: You need first to consider which KPI you want to analyse and what are the steps that lead to the main KPI.

**2. Prepare your dataset**: 4 steps are needed to properly set your dataset.
1. **Main KPI:** Define the main KPI you want to compare (e.g. Revenue, Leads, Margin...)
2. **Comparison Dimensions**: Define on which elements you want to compare your KPI (e.g. Period: Compare Month over Month, Country: Compare one country to the other...)
    - by default, Datama will select the first two elements of your dimension, or split a date range in two.
3. **Steps**: Define the steps that correspond to the funnel that lead to your main KPI. For example (eCommerce funnel, or Finance funnel) [See dataset examples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bNEeqm5CfpPmYPr_t4ff1xcJkSBKoVvwJd4vKB0sDzs/edit#gid=763618483)
    - To better define your steps (or metric equation), you can read our dedicated [article](https://datama.io/how-to-build-my-business-metric-relation/).
4. **Explanation dimensions**: Add Dimensions that will be used to explain the variations of your performance. Each variation will have an interest score to see how important they are to explain your variations.

<br/>

## 5. Read Your Analysis

- **Performance Overview**: Each blue bar represents the performance of your main KPI, using your chosen comparison dimension. helping you quickly gauge performance across different segments.
- **Intermediary Step Analysis**: Intermediary steps depict the ratio evolution of your KPI. The impact is quantified in the units of your main KPI, allowing for a consistent measurement of progress or regression.
- By default, the most interesting dimension will be selected for this zoomed step. You can change the selected dimension for this zoomed step by changing right clicking on the boxes of a segment and select the appropriate dimension in the "split by". You can unzoom by clicking on other steps or clicking on the box again.
- **In-Depth Exploration**: By interacting with a step‚Äîsimply click on it‚Äîyou'll delve into the underlying dimensions that are most influential in explaining your performance variances at each stage of your funnel.
