## 3. Analysis section

This slide represents a time series with all the anomalies (settings by default) or only a check on the latest available point in your dataset. Change this settings in the Subheader (<i>Analyse Latest Point Only</i>)

Change the ratio your are analysing by using the dropdown in the title. Within the dropdown KPIs are split between <i>KPIs with anomalies</i> and <i>Others KPIs</i>
