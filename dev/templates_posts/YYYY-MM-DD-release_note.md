This feature is available as a paid option - ask your customer success manager for early access <!--feature to be developed and tested-->

* **Extension:**
    * [Beta üß™] **New Tableau extension**: New tableau extension gives access to the new UI in Tableau. Benefits includes access to all charts & comments of the new UI (including new waterfall with decision tree viz), simplified process to create extension, and higher flexibility to use case customization <!--documentation to be done-->
    * Performance and user experience of extensions have been improved, providing faster results and allowing demo mode for all extensions based on the new UI

* **Compare:**
    * Display of the new waterfall (activate it using the ‚öôÔ∏è icon at top right of waterfall side) and tree view has been improved since beta release, with additional capabilities for customizing labels and layout

* **Pivot:**
    * **Clustering tree** is now available in the new UI, with enhanced vizualization. This helps you create clusters within your dataset accross multiple dimensions using regression tree machine learning <!--documentation to be done-->

* **Detect:**
    * **New detection methods**: detection methods has been revamped and enriched, adding 3 user defined threshold methods to make anomaly detection more flexible.
