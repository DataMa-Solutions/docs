# Slack & Email

> You don't have time to open the DataMa interface ... receive your analyses **directly in your mailbox** or on a **Slack channel**

By using the menu "export result" you can schedule for you or your boss an export directly to a mailbox at the frequency you want.

?> **Tip:** you can just as easily share your DataMa graphs in a Data Studio (or others) and configure the sending of emails from your data viz tool!
