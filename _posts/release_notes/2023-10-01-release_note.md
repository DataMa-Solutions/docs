* **Extensions:**
    * Looker Studio, PowerBI and Tableau extensions in the new UI have been improved to leverage cache when useful and now include a "reload" button to refresh the data and the settings

* **Compare:**
    * Performance for large datasets has been improved. As a result, large datasets run 20-30% faster than before
    * Top line labels are now available for each sub segments when opening a step
    * In tree view, the top X factor exploration method has been improved: right click on a box > exploration method > select the number of top contributors directly in the appropriate input. This will show the top contributors accross multiple dimensions.

* **Prep:**
    * Clean block has been revamped, and experience is improved in particular when deleting columns
    * Duplicate feature is available for a source block: by clicking on the "..." at bottom right of a source block, you can duplicate it and then edit the new duplicated block. This is useful for instance if you have on GA4 block on say, last month, and you want to append the same source for last year
