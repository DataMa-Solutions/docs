Noticed differences between your GA4 reports and BigQuery exports? ⏳

One of the reason might be that you are using incomplete intraday data, before it transitions to interday tables 📊

To get accurate Datama notifications, you might want to either postpone your schedules later in the day or switch to "fresh daily" tables ⏲

Need to check when your tables are fully updated?
