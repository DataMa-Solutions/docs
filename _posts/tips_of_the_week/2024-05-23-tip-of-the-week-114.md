Using Datama Detect, you can send instant notifications for when your key metrics fall outside of the confidence interval 🔔 Now, you can decide to flag anomalies only above or below confidence interval using the appropriate input in the settings ⚙️ This allows to get notified only when a KPI goes down (aka “bad news” 😅) , for instance.
Of course, you can also choose to only keep those above ⬆️, or keep the default of showing both ⬆️⬇️
