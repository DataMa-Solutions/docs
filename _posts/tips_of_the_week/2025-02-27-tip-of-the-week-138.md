Hey there! Just a heads-up that Datama chat, your direct link to our support team, is here to answer all your questions, receive your feedback, and listen to your insights while you browse the Datama APP.  

You can access the chat via the pop-up at the bottom right on the Home page, or by clicking into a use case, selecting Help at the top left, then “Chat with us” 💬—click it again to close it.  

Can’t wait to hear from you! 😊
