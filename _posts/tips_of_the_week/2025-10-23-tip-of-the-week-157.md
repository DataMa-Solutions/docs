New Dimension Helper is now available in Datama in Beta. You can access it by selecting the new version in the top-right panel of Filters or Comparisons.
Here’s what’s new and improved:
 * Split any dimension by any other dimension, including Comparison dimensions ✨
 * View two metrics at once, across both market equation steps and original dataset metrics 📊
 * Smooth animations with seamless transitions help you intuitively understand what’s being visualized 💫
 * Table view that allows a quick access to a tabular version of your data and export to a spreadsheet with a single click (as CSV copy) 📝
 * Easily switch between views like Bar + Lines, Overlay, and Moves thanks to multiple preset charts 💡
 * Faster calculations and an improved legend compared to the previous helper ⚡
