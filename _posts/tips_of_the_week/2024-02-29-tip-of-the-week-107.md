If you use Datama Detect 📈 to detect anomalies, you may have noticed some new features in the interface or in the email exports:
1. Datama now shows the trend of the main KPI in dotted lines on the graphs, so you can see whether the variation in this indicator really influences your overall performance.
2. In the event of an anomaly, a quantified overview of the impact on the main KPI is displayed, allowing you to quickly understand in what proportion a variation in a sub-indicator affects your main indicator. 🤓  

These features are enabled by default. You can deactivate them in the ⚙️ settings by unchecking "Compute Main KPI impact" and/or clicking on the "f" icon in the top right-hand corner to remove them from the main chart.
