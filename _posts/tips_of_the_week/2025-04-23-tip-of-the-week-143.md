You can now link Datama directly to a full table in Prep—no need to write a specific SQL query. Just connect your table in BigQuery, Snowflake, or Redshift, and handle all your filtering, comparisons, and clustering directly in Datama with our NoCode feature.

⚡Datama pulls only the data you need, auto-aggregates dimensions, and keeps things light and fast—so you can focus on insights.

🗒️Please note that after a table connect block, data refinement blocks cannot be used for the moment (e.g. “Clean”, “Aggregate” ...).

Smarter connections, faster insights. Try it out! 💡
