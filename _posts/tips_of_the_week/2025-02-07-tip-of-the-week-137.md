Available in Beta 🧪, “Views” allow you to save multiple versions of parameters in the same workbook. For example, you can save one “view” filtered on a specific country and another for all countries, or one with a complex market equation and another with a simplified market equation 🤓  

In this way, you can:
  * easily create and switch between views using the entry right next to the workbook title 📖
  * decide which view is sent for each export and it will point directly to the selected “View” 📩  

Don't hesitate to contact us to get access to this feature 😉
