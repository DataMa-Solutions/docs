On Datama Light extension, a new feature is available to spot anomalies like never before! ðŸ”Ž
Our latest update enables multi-dimensional outlier detection, giving you the power to uncover anomalies within any segment of your data dimension.
Example ðŸ“Š: Say you're analyzing performance by device category. While the global average may look fine here on session, Datama can now detect an unexpected spike or drop in a specific segment (uplift on mobile compensated by a drop on desktop).
Plus, each anomaly is scored for impact visible in the side table, so you focus on what truly matters first. âœ¨
