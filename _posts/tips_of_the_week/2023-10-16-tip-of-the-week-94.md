Last week we talked about secondary comparison. If you're in the overlay mode when you do a Secondary Comparison, there are two types of visualisation:
  * The first is where each segment/period is different, there are four segments A, B, C and D and you end up in the overlay view with A-B in the foreground and C-D in the background. This is the classic case when you are looking at a variation between two months and you want to compare them to the same variation the previous year.
  * The second, which is new and allows you to combine comparisons, is the format where you have two periods that follow each other (in an A-B and B-C format). In this case, Datama will combine the two views into a single foreground view, giving you a single view of the two waterfalls in the continuous A-B-C format. This is useful, for example, when you are looking at three consecutive weeks/months and want to compare their evolution. You can return to the superimposed view by right-clicking on one of the blue bars and selecting "Unmerge waterfalls on common bars".
