Calendars are coming to Datama and will become a key tool for better understanding your performance by integrating events 🎇🎆

You can now create or connect calendars from different sources (Google Sheets, Google Calendar, BigQuery, Excel, etc.) and synchronize them automatically.

By connecting them to your workbooks, you can find your events in:
 * the Helpers 📊
 * the enhanced comments 📰
 * the Light extensions on Detect and Explore 📉

Bonus: from Tableau, Power BI, or Qlik, you can create an event with a simple right-click. Datama thus becomes your central repository for key events. 📅
