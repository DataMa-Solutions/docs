In Datama, you can add a link üîó pointing to internal documentation linked to your workbook (for example a Wiki page, a Readme, a Notion page, or a Gslide presentation presenting the use case).
There are two ways of doing this:
  * From Home, click on the three little dots of a workbook card ‚û°Ô∏è "Edit" ‚û°Ô∏è and fill in the "Learn More" field.
  * In the workbook in "File" ‚û°Ô∏è "About this workbook" ‚û°Ô∏è and fill in the "Learn More" field in the same way.
