In Datama Compare, you can customise your decision tree 🌳 according to your needs, for example by highlighting the variation in % instead of the impact in value to simplify the discussion with the business 😉 

You can make these adjustments by going to the parameter menu ⚙️ and then to the "Label" section:
  * choose the order of the indicators
  * activate the colours 🎨 according to the variations for each indicator
  * add a variation arrow ↗️
  * limit the appearance of a field to the hover only 🥷🏽
  * completely hide certain fields
