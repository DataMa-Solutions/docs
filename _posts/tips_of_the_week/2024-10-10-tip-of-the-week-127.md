Want to stay ahead of the curve and catch anomalies the moment they happen? 🤔 Datama's enhanced anomaly detect service now lets you monitor customer behavior and its impact on your KPIs on an hourly basis! ⏱️

🚨 What's new?  

You can now get notified 📩 within just a few hours of an anomaly occurring, rather than waiting days to discover it. Simply change the alert frequency to “Hourly” in the “Schedule” configuration 🕔 (located at the top-right of the "Anomaly Detect" page). This ensures you're immediately informed when something goes wrong. ⚠️  

🔧 How it works  

This feature is available for any dataset📊 with hourly updates, making it ideal for users working with tools like GA4, ERP, CRM, CDP, DMP and more. 🖥️
