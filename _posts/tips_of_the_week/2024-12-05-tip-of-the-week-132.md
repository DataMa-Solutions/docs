Want to cluster certain values in your dataset before analysis? For instance:
  * Group small countries generating less than 3% of your revenue in a "Other" bucket.
  * Group ages into ranges (example: 18–24, 25–34) for easier analysis.
You can now compute Clustering Fields in Datama Prep using the "Clean" object. This feature allows you to group unique values from any dimension column into buckets using methodologies like Long Tail Aggregation or Regression Partitioning. It’s especially useful for large datasets!  

🛠️ 3 Simple steps to get it done:
  * After loading your dataset into Datama Prep, click the “+” icon at the top-right corner of the “Source” object, then select “Clean” 🖱️
  * Customize your Clustering Field: edit the group column name, select the base column and define your aggregation method on the left 📝
  * Apply and save changes: click “Apply” at the bottom-right to instantly see the new aggregated column ✅
