Want to go further in your analysis on Compare?

In Datama Compare, you can activate a second comparison. This allows you to display, in the background of your waterfall chart, the variations of another comparison or, if the periods are successive (comparison of period A to B and B to C), it will be displayed as two successive waterfall charts. 🤓

Ideal for highlighting your current results by comparing them, for example, to the same period last year... 📊
