A new block has appeared in Datama Prep: the 'Join' block, which lets you simply perform a join between two sources  ðŸ¥³

Very simple to use, it will be configured in two steps:
1. Choose the type of join you want to perform (Inner, Outer, Left, Right, Cross Join) ðŸ”—
2. Define the dimension(s) that will be used as join keys for each of the sources and apply ðŸ˜‰
