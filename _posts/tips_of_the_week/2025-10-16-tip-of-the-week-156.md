In the Datama Compare Light extension (on all visualization tools), you want to analyze a single metric with multiple dimensions (at least 3).

Datama allows you to automatically analyze your primary breakdown (e.g. Country), which will make up the stages of your Waterfall, and then the most relevant dimension (e.g. Channel) when you zoom in on a stage 🔍, all without any additional transformation 💡

Select your primary breakdown via the “Breakdown by” dropdown that appears at the top of the waterfall 🤓
