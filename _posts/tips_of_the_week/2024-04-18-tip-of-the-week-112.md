In Datama Compare, by default, the waterfall will open on the step and dimension most interesting to investigate 🕵🏽  

If you want to have all the steps closed by default, there's an option in the Waterfall settings: go to the settings icon ⚙️ at the top right of the Waterfall slide and uncheck the "Open biggest/focused element by default" option and that's it 😉
