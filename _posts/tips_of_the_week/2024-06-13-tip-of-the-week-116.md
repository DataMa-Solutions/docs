When using Datama Compare, you can now use the "Reverse palette" toggle to switch the bar colors 📊 This is helpful in cases where you're using a "negative" KPI where an increase is not good news, so it should be displayed in red instead of green (such as cost) 💸 The “Reverse palette” toggle is available in the Settings > Workbook Style > Language and colors section ⚙️
