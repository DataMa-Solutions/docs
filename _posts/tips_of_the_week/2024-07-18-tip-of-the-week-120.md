When setting up a comparison or filters on a Use Case, you can now configure them in more detail 😀  

To access this, when you're on a Datama solution, go to the ‘Settings’  ⚙️ at the top right and then select the ‘Dimension’ section, you'll then be able to configure three subsections:
  * Comparison: where you can define your comparisons and, in the case of relative saving, view the indexes and choose the order in which they are defined (Ascending 📈 or Descending 📉)
  * Filter: in the same way as in Comparison, you can apply filters and use relative saving on the selected dimensions 🎯
  * Auto-generated dimensions: to activate the dimensions calculated by Datama (combined dates, combined dimension or smart dimension) 🧮
