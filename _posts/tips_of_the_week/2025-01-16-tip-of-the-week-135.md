Besides Sunburst for visual observation of user journey, the Sankey diagram is available as an alternative option for journey's visualization 🌍  

This is particularly useful to visalize “loops” of multiple iterations on the same touch point. 💡  

As with Sunburst, Sankey is available in comparison mode to study behavioral differences on two different segments 🕵️
