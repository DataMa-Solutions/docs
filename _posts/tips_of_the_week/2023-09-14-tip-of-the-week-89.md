You already had the option of customising your preferences at workbook level to choose the language or colour scheme to apply to the graphics.ðŸŽ¨
Now, although this option is still available at workbook level, you can define the settings at user level, from Home. Select 'User Preferences' and the configuration will apply to all new workbooks you create. ðŸ˜‰
