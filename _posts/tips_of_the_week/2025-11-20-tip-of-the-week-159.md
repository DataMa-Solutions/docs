If you regularly export data from GA4, you’ve probably noticed that some metrics can be double-counted when broken down by certain dimensions.

For example, if you export your sessions by product type, any session that views multiple products will be counted more than once.

With the Prorate feature in Datama Prep, this issue disappears💡.

By enabling “Prorate metrics totals” before loading your GA4 data, you can safely pull metrics without inflating totals — whether overall or by dimension ✅.

Give it a try and let us know what you think!
