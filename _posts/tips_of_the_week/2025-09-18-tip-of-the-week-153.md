To reduce the size of your data, Datama offers several methods in the “Clean” block in the “New clustering field” section.  The “Top X based on Rank” method has just been added 🆕

With this method, you can now:
 * Keep only the best-performing segments of a dimension according to a given metric 🎯
 * Group all other segments into an “Other” bucket.

This approach reduces the size of your data and allows you to focus on the essentials while maintaining the relevance of the analysis 📊
