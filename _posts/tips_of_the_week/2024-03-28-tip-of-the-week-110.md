In Datama, you can give your feedback on a problem you have encountered or a potential improvement you have identified 💡  

A "Feedback" banner is accessible by hovering your mouse over the right-hand side of the screen at half-height, or by clicking in the "Help">"Feedback" menu. 📝  

We'll receive the message immediately, along with all the technical details needed to reproduce your environment and, if you like, a screenshot!
