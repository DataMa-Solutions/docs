In Datama Compare, you can easily see how different segments in one dimension affect your key metrics. By adding ‘Ranking’ and ‘Ranking Change’ to your table view, you can easily see the ranking of a segment on a KPI and the ranking change between the two values you are comparing.🥇🏆  

For example, you can see for the dimension “device”, “mobile” changed from rank 2 in the previous period, to rank 1 in the current period. This is equivalent to a 'Ranking Change' of +1 ⬆️  

To use this feature, click the “Table” tab, click the gear ⚙️ on the top right, and check the boxes for “Ranking” and “Ranking Change”. Try it out now and easily analyze performance trends! 🚀
Happy ranking! 🎉
