Wanna set up your preferred parameters just once and have them apply to all new workbooks? Don’t forget to configure your “User Preferences”.  


🔍 To get started, click on your name in the top-right corner of your homepage and head over to "User Preferences" ⚙️. Here, you can find all the parameters available for customization. For instance, if you prefer to set the “Confidence Interval” to 90% instead of the default 95%, simply click on “Detect Model” 📊 in the “User Preferences” list, adjust the percentage 📈, and save your changes by clicking on “Set As Default” 💾. From now on, every new workbook you create will automatically apply the 90% confidence interval 🔄.    


Make your workbooks work for you! 📝✨
