Good news: a new calendar connector is now available in Datama! 💡

**Google Analytics Annotations** can now be retrieved automatically via Calendars.

All events added directly in GA4 are imported into Datama and can be used like any other calendar 🗓️

This allows you to cross-reference Google Analytics annotations and business performance in your workbooks without having to re-enter data 😉
