Have you seen the tree chart view in Datama Compare? ðŸŒ³
By clicking on the Tree chart button in the top-right corner of your standard waterfall graph, you can visualize your data in a new way, showing the impact of all your dimensions at a glance ðŸ‘€
Right click on a box to explore top contributing segments across all dimensions and change other settings ðŸ”§ (in particular the exploration mode which, by switching to "Top X" mode, allows you to view the largest contributing segments across all dimensions)
