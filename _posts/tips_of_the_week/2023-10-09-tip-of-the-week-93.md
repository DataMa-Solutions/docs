You may be using secondary comparisons in Datama Compare - for example, to compare the variation of one country against another. Datama then displays 2 waterfalls: by default the display is superimposed with the first comparison in the foreground and the second in the background.
Now you can change the display by separating the second comparison into a new Waterfall, which will appear either on the right or below.
To access this, right-click on a block of the Waterfall, then Secondary Comparison and finally the display option you want from "Right", "Above" or "Overlay" ðŸ˜‰
