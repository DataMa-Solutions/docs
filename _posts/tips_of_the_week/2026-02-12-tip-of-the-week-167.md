When detecting anomalies and explaining variations, behind the data correlations that Datama helps you find, there are often more “qualitative” or “contextual” root causes for changes in performance. Holidays, campaigns, product launches, incidents, etc. all have an impact on indicators, but they are rarely taken into account in the analysis. 🗓️

With Datama Calendar, you can easily add business events (internal and external) to your dashboards and instantly visualize their impact on your KPIs. 📊
