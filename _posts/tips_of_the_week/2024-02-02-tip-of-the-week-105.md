A question that often comes up is: which segments drive change among all the dimensions? 🕵️‍♀️ Change can be explained by several segments. It would therefore be interesting to have a ranking of these segments according to their impact on the KPI.  


In DataMa Compare, thanks to the "Decision Tree" 🌳 that you will find on the first slide, it is possible to right-click to change the exploration method, which is by default in "hierarchical" order, to "Top X" drivers. The X can be selected from 1 to 50 😉  


Useful when you want to find the Top 3, 5 or 10 segments that explain the variation 🤓
