Until now, you had two options for anomaly detection on **Datama Detect Light**: either the entire dataset or only the last point. Not very granular, we admit ðŸ˜“
Now you can choose how many points you want to monitor for anomalies! ðŸŽ¯
**Use case**: do you send weekly reports? Set Detect to analyze only the last 7 days. Result: a prioritized list of anomalies over the last week, without unnecessary noise from past weeks.ðŸ“…
