If you connect Google Analytics to Datama and work with large datasets, GA4 might sample your data — which can lead to inaccurate insights.
Fortunately, the new “Avoid sampling” option in Datama Prep solves this! 💡
With one click, you can split your dataset into smaller chunks, so GA4 treats them as unsampled. You would get more accurate data, better decisions. 🎯
Try it now and see the difference in your analysis! 📊
