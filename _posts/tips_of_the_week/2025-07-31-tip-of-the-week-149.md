When you're tracking KPI variations between two periods (e.g., this week vs. last week), you usually know **how much** the KPI changed â€” but not **how meaningful** that change is compared to historical patterns.

Thatâ€™s exactly what **Datama Assess â€“ Volatility** helps with.

Letâ€™s say your average basket dropped by x% from Week 45 to Week 46. With Assess, you can instantly compare this variation with previous week-to-week changes (Week 44 â†’ 45, 43 â†’ 44, etc.). This allows you to understand whether the drop is within the normal range â€” or whether it's an outlier worth investigating.

ðŸ§  In short: you stop reacting blindly to KPI movements and start knowing when they truly matter.

ðŸ‘‰ Try it now on our website version or directly in the Datama extension (Looker studio, PowerBI, Tableau, and Qlik).
