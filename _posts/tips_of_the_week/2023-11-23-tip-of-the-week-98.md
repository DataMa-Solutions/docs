ðŸ”¥New this week: the "Duplicate this bloc" function is now available in Prep! Here's how it works:
1. Select the Source Block you want to duplicate.
2. Click on the Three Small Dots "..." located on the Source Block.
3. Choose "Duplicate this block" ðŸ“š: With one click, create an exact copy of your block, with all the parameters already configured.

âœ¨ Why is this handy? Imagine: you have a GA4 block configured for last month. With duplication, easily create a version for last year. Time saving and efficiency guaranteed!
Take advantage now and boost your productivity with Prep! ðŸ˜‰
