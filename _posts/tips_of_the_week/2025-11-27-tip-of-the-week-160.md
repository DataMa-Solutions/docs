With a single click from the output block in Prep, **AI now suggests a market equation** based solely on the names of your columns and any optional context you provide (to specify the currency, for example, or the analysis you want to perform).
 *  No data from your dataset is shared—only metadata (column name and data type, e.g., string, float, date, etc.)—to ensure **complete confidentiality**   🔒
 *  You can use your own OpenAI key to maintain control over the license 🔑
A first step towards integrating LLMs into data preparation and analysis...more to come soon 🚀
