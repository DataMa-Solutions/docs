In Datama Compare, the waterfall will group dimensions with smaller effects into the 'Remaining' category to simplify the view 📊 However, you can easily examine these categories more closely by simply clicking to expand any bars labeled 'Remaining' 🔍 

You can also customize how many segments appear per dimension before they are put in the 'Remaining' category in Settings ⚙️
