You can now directly compare two metrics (numeric columns) in **Datama Extension**!  

For example, if you need to compare your **Budget** and **Actual Revenue**, it only takes a few clicks.  

* ✅ Make sure both metrics are added in the Setup panel of your BI tool.
* ⚙️ Go to **Settings → Comparison Definition → Compare by Metric**, then select the metrics you want to compare, give this step a name, and click **Apply**.
