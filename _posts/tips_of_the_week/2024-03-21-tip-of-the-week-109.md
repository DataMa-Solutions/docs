Would you like the answer to the question "How many sessions have left the site?"  🤔  


Datama has created the option that allows you to have the answer in Journey, by activating "Display exits" in the settings ⚙️.  


This allows you to display the "output" of journeys on the sunburst ☀️, so you can hover your mouse over it and get the share of volume (in %) exiting your journeys for a given path.
