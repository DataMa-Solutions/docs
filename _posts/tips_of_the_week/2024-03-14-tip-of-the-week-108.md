In Journey you can change the reading of your sunburst ☀️. By going to the options, you can tick "Reverse sunburst" 🔄️ , reversing the reading direction from external to the center of the sunburst.

This allows you to pose the problem in reverse by no longer answering the question "What does the user do after reaching a milestone?", but elucidating "What led users to reach this milestone?" 😎
