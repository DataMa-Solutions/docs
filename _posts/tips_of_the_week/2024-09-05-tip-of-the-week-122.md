Whether it's Slack, Teams or email exports, you can customise each export with parameters that are independent of the use case backup.  

Here are a few examples of what you can change:
  * Change the comparison dimensions to send a Compare in Month over Month and an other in Week over Week 🗓️
  * Add filters to set up an export by country or by acquisition channel 🎯
  * Adjust the style and language to create exports tailored to your audience 🤓
  * And many other cases that we'll leave you to imagine 💭
