The latest release brings a host of new features, including a new approach to filters and comparison! ðŸŽ‰
How does it work? ðŸ¤”  

First access the comparison: click on "Comparison" then select the dimension you want to compare on (Optional: select "Secondary Comparison" to add an additional comparison).  
Then select your segments: choose the segments for each of your comparisons to refine your analysis as much as possible.  

What's new?:
  * The interface has been clarified to give a better view of the filters applied to each of the comparisons. Click on 'Filters' to tick the different choices available for each of your comparisons âœ…
  * New operators: use a new operator in the filters to refine your searches (by inclusion or exclusion criteria, "contains", etc.) ðŸŽ¯
