A new page is available on the Datama Home page 😀  

By going to "My Account" and then "Products" in the left-hand menu, you will arrive on the page with all the integrations in the data visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI and Looker Studio 📊  

Here you will find the following information:
  * your licence keys 🗝️, which can be copied in one click
  * extension download links ⬇️
  * as well as links to the documentation to find out what you can do and how to install them 👀
