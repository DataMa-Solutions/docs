🚀 **New feature available in Datama Prep!** It is now possible to define several date ranges in the same source block for GA4 and Piano connectors. 🎯
  * This avoids the need to create several separate blocks (e.g. one for last year and another for this year) and then merge them.
  * What's more, you can add a «**Date range**» column to facilitate comparison, without having to use a date dimension. 🔥
