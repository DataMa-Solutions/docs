A search shortcut has been introduced on all Datama pages by pressing CTRL + F. When you do a search 🔍 the results will be divided into the following sections:
* Settings: (only when you are in a workbook) which allows you to edit a workbook setting ⚙️
* Workbooks: to find your workbooks without going through the home page 📂
* Documentation: to get links to the documentation 📄
