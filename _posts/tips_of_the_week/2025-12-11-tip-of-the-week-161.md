Good news for all Datama clients! We’ve launched—now in beta—the **new Datama Explore (aka Helper)**, available on Datama Web and as an extension to anyone with a Datama licence.
This extension streamlines your setup while enriching your analytical capabilities with:
 * **Self-service flexibility** ⚙️
Instantly select any dimension, metric (Market Equation), and visualization type—no need to pre-build complex parameters in your BI tool.
 * **Instant variation analysis** 📈
Define comparisons on the fly to automatically generate Δ and % Change metrics across all KPIs.
 * **Advanced charts** 📊
Leverage exclusive visuals such as **Moves** (to understand mix effects) and **Mekko** (to explore size and composition) for deeper insights.
