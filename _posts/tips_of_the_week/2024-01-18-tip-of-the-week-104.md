When you carry out an analysis where a downward variation is seen as positive (e.g. analysis of purchasing costs), it is then possible to change the colours of the workbook in question to show increases in red 🔴 and decreases in green 🟩.

Go to Settings ➡️ Workbook Style ➡️ select Colors palet=custom ➡️ then define each of your colours for the Waterfall 🎨
