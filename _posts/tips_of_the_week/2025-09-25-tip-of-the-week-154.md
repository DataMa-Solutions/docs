If you use Datama Extensions in Tableau or Looker Studio, you can control which version of the extension is used in your dashboards. 

This is useful when your dashboards are highly exposed, and you want to make sure the latest release doesn’t introduce unexpected features or bugs for your users. 💡 

How to proceed:
 * Go to Datama 👉My account 👉 Extensions, choose Tableau or Looker Studio.
 * In the targeted extension, replace “Latest” with the version you want to keep (from the drop-down list), then click the download/copy icon on the right.

Your BI tool will automatically load the extension with the chosen version. ✅

You can check the applied version directly in the extension settings.
