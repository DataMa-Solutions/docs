Happy New Year!  🎊

2025 was an intense year at Datama (Table Connect, Views, Datama Explore, AI Generator, Segment Detection, etc.) 🚀

2026 promises to be even more ambitious: multi-level KPI Trees & Market Equations, centralization and exploitation of events, Excel & Gsheet extensions, even better AI integration 🤖

Let's discuss it during our Customer Success calls 📞

Datama loves you 😍
